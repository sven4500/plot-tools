Hello everyone! It's Ivars here.

This is open-source plotting library distributed under GPLv3 license for Qt framework.

## Philosophy

While contributing to this project some of important statements should be considered. Here goes some of the philosophy:

- Headers only. This project should contain headers only. Although there are no strong reasons why, one of the rationale would be because of the templates (see below). Other reason is that headers are easier to add to your project. Add **INCLUDEPATH** to your **.pro** file and you are ready to go.
- Templates. Widgets should be templates wherever it is reasonable.
- Simplicity. The use of widgets should be as easy as possible both programmatically and interactively. Sometimes with sacrifice of ability to customize widgets look.
- Qt style. The way programmer interacts with widgets should feel similar to Qt widgets.
